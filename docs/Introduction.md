# Introduction

This document serves as an introduction to ClipDataMod

## How ClipDataMod Works

ClipDataMod when launched lives behind an icon
in your system tray next to the clock.

*Non-Windows platforms may display the icon and menu differently*

Right clicking on the icon shows the menu with a list of all plugins.
Plugins can either directly operate on the menu item,
or have submenus with more options.

Most actions are performed immediately and silently,
but more complicated plugin actions may render additional dialog windows.

An extra option to exit the application is provided as well.
